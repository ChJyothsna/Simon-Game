# Simon-Game

Simon Game is a simple memory which is mostly placed by the kids. I have designed a game that slightly resembles to the original simon game.

As part of Web Development, the designed this project.

Languages Used:

    => HTML (Hyper Text MarkUp Language)
    => CSS  (Cascading Style Sheets)
    => Jquery
  
Hyper Text MarkUp Language:

    - HTML used for structure of the game.
    - I used
        => buttons
        => div tags
 
 Cascading Style Sheets:
 
    - CSS gives the styling and layout to the game.
    - To style the game
            => background-colors
            => border
            => css selectors (classs, id)
          
JQuery:

    - JQuery is a JavaScript Library which gives functionality to the page and also allows the interaction with the user.
    - I used many pre-built functions in JQuery
            => $ - for selecting the elements
            => fadeIn() and fadeOut() - for animating the buttons
            => Event handlers like "keypress" and "click" to handle key and button clicks.
